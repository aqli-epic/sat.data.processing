# sat.data.processing

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Goals of sat.data.processing:

-   To serve as the single place for all code and documentation that
    goes into processing the satellite derived PM2.5 raw netCDF data
    (alongside the population data and relevant shape files) to get a
    final dataset which is used to build the AQLI interactive Choropleth
    Global PM2.5 map platform.

-   Please note that there is a “data”, folder in this repository, which
    I have decided to keep out because it exceeds GitHub file size
    limits. To get access to any raw data files in the code, please
    write a small request note to us on <aqli-info@uchicago.edu>.
