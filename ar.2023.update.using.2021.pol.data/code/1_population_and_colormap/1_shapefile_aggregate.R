# Account for Telangana's many new districts. As of April 2019, there are 33 new districts.

# I started off with a base shape file of Telangana. This is not a gadm shapefile, its a different one
# (as listed above), because the gadm level 2 shape file only takes into account a subset of the 33 districts of Telangana. This is why we have
# to use a separate shape file for Telangana. But, even this new shapefile loaded in "telangana_districts" variable above does not contain
# 2 sub-district polygons. Two sub-districts of Bhadradri Kothagudem district (Bhadrachalam, Borgampad) are not included in the above definition of Bhadradri Kothagudem.
# These 2 sub-districts will be "unioned" with the rest of the definition of Bhadradri Kothagudem. All of this is done in QGIS. It can be done
# in R, but the st_union function of R is less accurate than the corresponding "dissolve" feature of QGIS. So, I have modified the base raw shapefile
# of Telangana, by making this additional adjustment. I'll directly load this file in and it'll be named the "telangana_districts_adjusted", to differentiate it from
# the raw telangana shape file (both of these will be present in the data/raw folder itself, the raw file can be identified with the "raw" suffix in
# front of it).

# In case you want to recreate the steps by which I got the asjusted base shape file for Telangana in QGIS, do this:

# Step 1: Take a symmetrical difference between telangana state level shape file (stored in the "telangana_other/telangana_state_gadm1" folder)
# and the telangana district level shape file (stored in the "telangana_raw_districts" folder). This will give you a shape that will comprise
# of the two missing sub-districts of Bhadradri Kothagudem (Bhadrachalam, Borgampad) and some additional space, which we will group into
# Bhadradri Kothagudem itself.

# Step 2: Use the output from Step 1 and to it add the rest of the "Bhadradri Kothagudem" (present in the telangana_other/bhadradri_kothagudem_district folder),
# by using a "union" operation. Then, dissolve this union into a single polygon, which will then be the final "Bhadradri Kothagudem" district.

# Step 3: Add the output from Step 2, to the "everything_except_bhadradri_kothagudem_district_non_gadm.shp" file (by taking a union), present in the folder of the
# same name.

# At this point, you'll have a final Telangana base shape file that I'll further clean in R below.

# Also, just a quick note - past code that was used to make similar adjustments to Telangana was inaccurate and it left a blank white spot
# in the map (which can be seen if you zoom in around the areas mentioned above). That spot is fixed using the above process. So, all past adjustment
# code has been removed. Also, in the past code comments it was mentioned that Bhadrachalam and Bhadradri are supposed to be part of
# Andhra Pradesh, but that's not true, they belong in the "Bhadradri Kothagudem" district of Telangana itself.

# In the old shape file it was assumed that parts of Bhadradri Kothagudem stayed in Andhra Pradesh's East Godavri region and were grouped
# back into AP. But, that is incrorect. Those parts should stay in "Bhadradri Kothagudem" (which is a district in Telangana), and the above
# Telangana adjustment takes that into account. So, now the additional adjustment in AP's West/East Godavri region is not needed (hence removed). Also, previously,
# the AP adjustment was leading to a "white" crack in the map, a place with no data lying at the border of  East Godavri and Bhadradri
# Kothagudem. But, the above Telangana adjustment has now fixed that, such that there is no place with in Telangana or AP, where there is
# missing data.
